		<h3>EXCEPTIONS AND GIVEN</h3>
			<p>Automated feeds make it easier to send product data to Google, which will let people find information about your products across various Google touch points as well as allow you to show your products and reach new customers globally.</p>
			<h4>How it works</h4>
			<p>Automated feeds uses a feature called website crawl, which uses crawls of your website to read structured data and sitemap information to extract the most up-to-date information about relevant products from your website.

			In order for those website crawls to work for automated feeds, you'll have to add schema.org structured data markup to your website. Learn more about structured data markup

			Google also reads your website's sitemaps to comprehensively crawl your site. Learn more about sitemaps

			After you've added structured data markup to your site, the feed input method "website crawl" will become available in your Merchant Center account when you are creating a new primary feed. This will then create product data in the Feeds section of your account.
